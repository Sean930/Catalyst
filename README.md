# Catalyst
Catalyst script task

This is the task for Catalyst, used for parsing a CSV file, processing data from the CSV file then store data into MySQL.

##Uasage

Before running this script, I suppose the users.csv file has been put into the same directory as the user_upload.php file. And MySQL
is successfully installed and stated.

While runing this script, users can run --dry_run command to parse the CSV file, however, users should enter correct username, password 
and host address with port number before run --create_table command and --file command.
